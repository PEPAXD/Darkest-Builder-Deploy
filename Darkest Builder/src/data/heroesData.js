Hellion uses Toe to Toe to stay in place and tank, while Alhazred repositions Audrey to repeat the cycle. The Plague Doctor (PD) or Vestal (Seraph) provide healing and support, depending on whether you prefer consistency or additional mitigation.

The Plague Doctor handles backline damage with Plague Grenade and Magnesium Rain, and provides healing. The Occultist adds extra backline damage with Abyssal Artillery and offers mitigation through curses and pulls. The choice between Jester and Dismas depends on whether you need flexibility or reliability; Jester offers Finale and movement skills but is more vulnerable, while Dismas provides consistent damage and bulk. The Hellion delivers strong frontline damage and tanking with Toe to Toe and can use Howling End for a powerful alpha strike. This comp is highly effective in Act 2, the Tangle, and cultist fights, focusing on backline destruction with flexibility.",
