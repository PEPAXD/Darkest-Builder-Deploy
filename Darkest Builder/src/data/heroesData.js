Due to his rather erratic movements, the Jester may present risk when fit into a team who requires Rank consistency or lacks flexibility in movement. Notably, the Jester excels at applying Combo Token, possessing 4 skills that can inflict said Token in total, more than any other Heroes. Due to his highly flexible skillset with a good target reach, the Jester can reliably perform on any Rank, especially on middle Ranks. Jester has a more supporting role on Rank 3 where he can effectively Stress heal, buff his team or Pull targets, while on Rank 2 he can use Finale ability to deal a strong blow on resilient targets.",

While also being able to receive large amounts HP damage and stress for the team, protecting his allies. The main problem the player will see is Blind tokens. Fortunately Leper has the tools to combat this as  ability Reflection allows you to clear Blind. Leper main damage abilities are able to ignore Blind if you have Combo. The Leper's biggest downside is that he's restricted to the front two ranks. He has no way of attack from the back, and he has no ability that moves him forward, forcing him to move one rank at a time with his regular movement. This means enemies like Pit Fighter or The Lord are a big threat to Leper since these enemies can push him back with strong Knockback abilites.",
